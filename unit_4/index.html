	<h3>Tonya's Childhood</h3>
	<p>Tonya was born in 1970 in Portland, Oregon to LaVona Golden and Albert Harding. To say that Tonya had a conventional or idyllic childhood would be a disservice to the struggles she overcame from the very beginning of her life.</p>
	<p> Tonya's mother, LaVona, was physcically and psychologically abusive towards Tonya from a very early age. In fact, Tonya has stated that by the time she was seven the abuse had become a regular part of her life. What was irregular was Tonya's skating ability. She had been skating since she was three years old. Skating may have formed an outlet that allowed Tonya to escape from the reality of abuse and poverty inflicted upon her.</p>
	<p> Tonya's parents struggled to adequately support Tonya. LaVona held a job as a waitress to support the family, but often came up short. LaVona was known to have drank quite a bit at the time, and was often seen drinking at the ice rink when she came to see Tonya skate. However, LaVona would sew Tonya's costumes for skating competitions because the family did not have enough money to purchase new ones. LaVona was doing the best she could to support Tonya, but as Tonya got older there were incidents which led to an estrangement between the mother and daughter.
