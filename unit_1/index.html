	<p> The Lacefront Institute of Technology (LIT) was created by Rupaul and Lady Bunny in 1969. The orginal campus in New York's East Village is still in operation today, and in 1999 LIT expanded to two new campuses. We now have campuses in San Francisco and Tuckahoe, NY. Please see our course and degree offerings above and do not hesitate to speak with one of our admissions advisors today!</p>
